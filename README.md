# My-Story
I have over 6 years of experience in User Experience Design where I developed assets and managed design systems of large corporates like OpenText (https://www.opentext.com/), Digital Main Street (https://digitalmainstreet.ca/) and CommuniTech (https://communitech.ca/) across 3 countries. This extensive experience has given me the ability to identify any problem and develop a fully functional detailed website.

Actively seeking opportunities in UX/UI Design roles in Toronto and Kitchener-Waterloo region, Canada.

I also have 3+ years of experience as a Business Development Analyst (Marketing) in the Information Technology industry where I created customer experiences through designing mobile apps and web apps (using Shopify, WordPress, WIX and other Content Management Systems). I also worked on optimizing company sales, creating a project plan, assigning marketing budget for campaigns, running social media campaigns, sales of digital products and project delivery with awesome customer service.
